## Some useful content templates for publishing packages

This repo provides content templates for repos that will publish packages to pub.dev.

You will find sample markdown content in the following files:
1. [PACKAGE_README.md](PACKAGE_README.md)
2. [PACKAGE_EXAMPLE.md](PACKAGE_EXAMPLE.md)
3. [PACKAGE_CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Usage

As these are simple markdown files, the easiest way to use them is to copy the raw markdown
and paste them into the corresponing files in the project for your package. The template 
includes comments explaining the content structure to be helpful.

## Contributions are welcome

Please feel free to submit issues or enhancement requests for these templates. We aim to 
continuously improve everything we do appreciate any contributions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) 
for details on how to do this.
